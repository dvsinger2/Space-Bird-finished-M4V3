# no user code! But tips for making your game


# ---- RUNNING THE GAME :] ----
# ---- 1 -----
# play the game first. Use the space key to move up.

# ---- optional warm up: -----
# notice how we can't reach the star! 
# use section (F) to write if statements so that we can click our keys to move it. 

# ---- optional challenge warm up: -----
# our bird can go off the screen to reach the star. 
# use section (G) to write if statements and use comparison operators (<=, >, <)
# to stop the bird from leaving the screen
# notice how the rectangle has attributes like bottom. This means we don't have to do math. 
# see if you can use other attributes. 


# ---- REGULAR START :0 -------

# --- 1 ----
# Section (A)
# Change your window width, height, game icon, and game caption


# --- 2 ----
# Section (B)
# Upload and pick a cool game background
# You might have to adjust your window height and width (A) to fit it

# --- 3 ----
# Section (C)
# Change the player image, x, y, and speed
# Notice how the rectangle also has attributes like centerx

# --- 4 ----
# Section (D)
# Change the strings in argument 1 of the title text and subtitle text variables
# Change the integers in fancy_font and fancy_font_small to change the font size
# Upload a new font. Then change the font path strings in fancy_font and fancy_font_small
# Change the third argument of title_text_rect and subtitle_text_rect to change the color
# For one, use a string, for the other, use an (R, G, B) tuple
# Change the x and y for title_text_rect and subtitle_text_rect to move their locations.
# Optional: Try accessing other attributes than centerx or y of your rectangles. See what happens

# --- 5 ----
# Section (E)
# Write two lines of code below the goal_rect to change it's x and y position

# --- 6 ----
# Section (F)
# Play around with the keys and if statements to make things happen.
# If you completed the warm up, add if statements and keys to make the goal rect move
# type pygame.k and you will see a list off all the keys

# --- 7 ----
# SECTION (G)
# If not done already: 
# Write if statements and use comparison operators (<=, >, <)
# to stop the player from leaving the screen

# --- 8 ----
# SECTION (H)
# Change the += operator to make the player go up always

# --- 9 ----
# SECTION (I)
# Create another collision statement. Use your imagination
# Hint: You may want to make another surface :0

# --- 10 ----
# SECTION (J)
# Comment out your background and run your code
# Play around with commenting and un-commenting 


# -------- QUICK START - CREATE YOUR OWN GAME ------
# This is your chance to get creative! :]
# You have 80% of what you need to make a full game
# Consider creating enemies, obstacles, power ups, multiple players, etc.
# Consider creating win screens, lose screens, etc.
# Consider having moving obstacles
# Consider making your player jump
# The possibilities are endless

# helpful hints: Take your time! This is your change to get a feel for the game design competition.
# rewatch and work alongisde the module videos for the areas you get stuck on.
# print things out and create useful logs to see what things do
# comment things out to see what they do

# good luck :]
